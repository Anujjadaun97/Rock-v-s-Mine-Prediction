**Rock vs. Mine Prediction**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine.ipynb) that implements a Logistic Regression model to classify objects as either a rock or a mine based on sonar data.

**Project Tasks**:
The notebook performs the following key tasks:

**Load Data**: The sonar data is loaded from a CSV file named sonar_data.csv.

**Process Data**: This involves initial exploration of the dataset, including viewing the head of the dataframe and checking its dimensions, and descriptive statistics.

**Train and Split Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.

**Logistic Regression Model**: A Logistic Regression model is used for the classification task.

**Use Trained Data for Prediction**: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.

**Libraries Used**:
The following Python libraries are imported and used in the notebook:

numpy (as np)

pandas (as pd)

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split

sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression

sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score
